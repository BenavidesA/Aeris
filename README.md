# Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Prediction System

This project aims to provide a system for monitoring, recording, and predicting pollution levels in various zones based on the levels of several pollutants (CO2, SO2, NO2, PM2.5) and weather conditions (temperature, wind speed, and humidity).

## Features

1. **Add new zone**: Allows adding a new zone to the system along with the current pollution levels and weather conditions.
2. **Current pollution monitoring**: Displays the current pollution levels for all registered zones.
3. **Generate report**: Creates a detailed report on pollution levels in the zones.
4. **Historical average**: Calculates the average pollution levels over the past 30 days for each zone.
5. **Future pollutant prediction**: Uses historical data to predict pollutant levels for upcoming days.

## File Structure

### `historico.txt`
This file contains historical data from the last 30 days for each zone. Data for each zone is stored in plain text format and can be manually modified. The format for each line is as follows:

Zona [Zone Name] [CO2] [SO2] [NO2] [PM2.5] [Temperature] [Wind] [Humidity]


**Note**: The `historico.txt` file can be manually modified to adjust historical data for zones. It is recommended to follow the specified format to avoid errors when processing the data.

### `recomendaciones.txt`
This file is automatically generated after generating a report, containing recommendations on how to mitigate the effects of pollutants based on the recorded levels.

## System Requirements

- Programming language: C
- Development environment: Compatible with standard C compilers.
- Necessary files: `zonas.txt`, `historico.txt`, `recomendaciones.txt`.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Add a zone**: Choose the corresponding option in the menu to enter a new zone and its data.
2. **View current pollution monitoring**: Check the current pollution levels for all zones.
3. **Generate a report**: Run the option to generate a report on pollution levels.
4. **View historical average**: Calculate the average pollution levels over the last 30 days for each zone.
5. **Pollutant prediction**: Get a prediction of pollutant levels for upcoming days.
